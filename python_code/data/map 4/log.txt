after good performence in map 3 , try the two agent again in map 4

permanent dirt positions: [[8, 5], [3, 5], [8, 1], [8, 8], [6, 5]] (note that the board was change)
human player position: [1][5]
computer player position: [4][7]

the reward function is change to:
rewards = {
        'Start': 0.5,
        0: -0.01, #stay
        1: -0.05, #left
        2: -0.05, #up
        3: -0.05, #right
        4: -0.05, #down
        'CollectDirt': 0,  # (-2 + 2 = 0)
        'EndGame': 1.0,
        'invalidAction': -0.05
    }
    
the board was change to:
var gameMap = [
	0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
	0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0,
	0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,
	0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0,
	0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,
	0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0,
	0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0,
	0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,
	0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0,
	0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
];

run again only for the selfish baseline
